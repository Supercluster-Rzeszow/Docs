# Bill of Materials

Before your journey to space you must gather necessary equipment. We prepared a list of parts to help you build your own high-altitude balloon.

## Most important 

1. Weather balloon - After calculating the payload weight and the desired flight altitude, the appropriate balloon must be selected. Manufacturers provide assumed payload weights and flight altitudes to assist in balloon selection. LINK DO PRZYKŁADOWEGO BALONU
2. Parachute - A parachute suspended between the balloon and the capsule is needed to protect your cargo and allow it to return safely to the ground after the balloon bursts. The size of the parachute is determined by the weight of your payload. LINK DO PRZYKŁADOWEGO SPADOCHRONU
3. Payload box - The Styrofoam box helps protect your cargo from the cold at high altitudes that can cause electronics to fail and while falling to the ground. The box should measure about 10x10x10 cm and have a wall thickness of about 3 cm. LINK DO PRZYKŁADOWEGO PUDEŁKA
4. Cord - The parachute and payload is attached to the balloon by a cable. It must be of adequate strength to withstand the weight of the payload and the stresses of the launch. Polyethylene lines with a tensile strength of approximately 300 N are recommended. You can use cords designed for kites. LINK DO PRZYKŁADOWEJ LINKI
5. Electronic Parts. A pressure sensor, GPS and a radio transmitter are required for the flight. You can extend your system with other measuring elements or cameras. Detailed information is presented in the "avionics" tab. PODLINKUJ TU ELEKTRONICZNY BOM
6. Pressure regulator and gas cylinder. You can purchase gas from professional stores that distribute industrial gases.  Make sure you are familiar with the safety rules for working with technical gases. TUTAJ TRZEBA WIĘCEJ OSTRZEŻEŃ

## And not so obvious

- Prepare insulating tape and duct tape. The insulating tape will be used to secure the neck of the balloon. The second will be useful for taping the cargo box.
- Use elastic bands to close the neck of the balloon. They should be thick (about 2-3 mm) and strong enough.
- Stock up on a piece of polystyrene to fill the empty space in your cargo container with. This will provide extra protection from the cold and increase durability.
- Very mundane but important - you need scissors to cut the string. NOTE Conduct all cord cutting activities away from the balloon.
- Battery to power avionics. It is best to use a regular disposable battery as it can withstand cold temperatures better. LiPo and LiIon batteries lose capacity quickly as temperatures drop.
- Prepare the tools to cut the polystyrene and assemble the cargo box. You can use an all-purpose knife to cut the polystyrene blocks and a screwdriver to cut a small hole in the cargo box. NOTE Conduct all polystyrene cutting activities away from the balloon.
- Gloves. Simple work gloves will help you avoid accidental balloon damage.
- You may need a tarp or mat to provide a smooth surface when filling the balloon to avoid the possibility of accidental damage to the shell. A simple piece of thicker plastic wrap about 3 x 3 meters in size should be sufficient.
