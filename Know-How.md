## 1. Planning balloon route
The primary requirement for allowing a balloon to fly is adequate weather. Avoid windy days. Never release the balloon during a storm or rain.
Never release a balloon without first planning your route. We have developed tools that allow you to estimate your balloon's likely route.
Make sure that the balloon has no chance to fly over bodies of water, because in that case the cargo will sink and be impossible to recover. Pay attention to whether the balloon will not cross the state border during the flight. While it may still be possible to recover the payload, it will make it much more difficult. Try to launch the balloon in a flat area with no terrain obstacles such as tall buildings or forests.
## 2. Testing avionics
Before releasing the balloon, test the operation of all electronics, especially the GPS receiver and radio transmitter. These are essential for recovering the payload after the balloon bursts. Test at least twice before the scheduled balloon launch. Take your time and if you find a bug, postpone the entire operation until you've reviewed and tested all the code once again. Never agree to attach untested electronics to the balloon. It can disrupt your components and lead to loss of communication with the balloon - and ultimately failure of the entire operation because you won't be able to find and recover the payload.
## 3. Preparing payload box
Proper preparation of the payload enclosure ensures its survival in the higher atmosphere and safe return to earth. 
After placing the electronics inside, fill the remaining space with polystyrene blocks. Remember to drill a small hole in the wall to equalize pressure. This should be near the pressure and temperature sensor so that it provides the most accurate measurements possible. 
Always remove the electronics when making modifications to the housing! Accidentally touching the integrated circuits with a screwdriver or knife can lead to a short circuit and irreparable damage to the device.
## 4. Filling and tying off

## 5. Launching a balloon
A critical phase of the entire project is the balloon launch. Always conduct it with several people - a solo launch is possible, but extremely difficult to do. 
Once the balloon is filled with gas, one person must hold the balloon until you have attached the parachute and the payload. This can take some time and be tiring - plan your changes so that the balloon is released under full control, avoiding sudden releases or jerks. 
The parachute and payload should be lifted upwards - don't let the balloon lift them off the ground by its own buoyancy alone. This will limit the stress on the cord and minimize the risk of it breaking.
